# Airport Challenge

A command line software that controls the flow of planes in an airport.

## Motivation

Week 1 Makers Academy challenge to learn about:
* Writing code that is easy to change
* Applying test-driven development
* Using object-orientated programming
* Ruby to a deeper degree

## Tech/framework

Built with Ruby and RSpec for testing

## Installation

Rspec

## How to use?

run irb in terminal
require './lib/airport' or equivalent path

## Approach

## Assumptions
 - 20% chance of a storm
 - Airport instance starts with 0 planes
 - Default capacity is 20

### Setting weather condition  
The weather condition was set using a random number generator with the assumption that there will be 20% likelihood of a storm preventing the planes landing and taking off
